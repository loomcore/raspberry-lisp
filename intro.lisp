;; Introduction

;; Since the introduction and the first chapter only cover a bit
;; about the history of Lisp and how to set up CLISP (and I've
;; already covered ECL setup in Part 0), I'll skip them in the
;; interests of getting down to some actual hackery.

;; In case you missed it, Part 0 can be found at:
;; http://yeel.es/2012/07/06/the-land-of-raspberry-lisp-part-0.html
